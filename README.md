# BUTTERFLYCLASSIFICATION

A simple color analysis method to distinguish between butterflies categories.

Having ten different classes of butterflies, each class has its own coloring features; 
the aim was to be able to specify any input image of one specific butterfly to its correct class
which it belongs to, using MATLAB platform. And by using filtering over the image layers;
such as Hue, Lab and Value filters we could recognize the special featuring colors of each class, 
and we could successfully classify any input butterfly image of these classes by total accuracy above 40%.
